Actually the first shot is from Saint Maud. But I highly recommend Benedetta, a very Verhoevenian movie for sure

Also you should give saint Maud a watch when you can! I liked it. It didn't strike me in the way that the lodge did, like a punch to the throat, but it was really well crafted and enjoyable. 

Also very visually pleasing.",ü¶á ü¶ë,,,,[],https://twitter.com/deaddropfredd/status/1507560368129904641

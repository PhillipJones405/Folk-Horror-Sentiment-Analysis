“In this sense, the subject of “Midsommar” is the absurdity and obtuseness of suspending moral judgment for other cultures in the name of curiosity, respect, or relativism.” Bingo. Aster requires his protagonists to be stupid, immoral, or both - and not for interesting reasons.

1) It wasn’t a horror film like ex: James Wan & the insidious franchise where he uses precise “pop up” scare tactics & just scary ass demons/dolls/nuns that would typically creep the average viewer out to begin with. Midsommar played on real life cultural practices

Indeed. We word-police so many things today that it can become reflexive, but this doesn’t need to be one of them. We can “tomayto/tomahto” Midsommar without having to call the whole thing off. ",😊,,,,[],https://twitter.com/CantUnseeMovie/status/1155136618673692672
